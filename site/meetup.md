# Join our monthly community meetup!

Every second Monday of the month at 16:00 UTC / 18:00 Berlin / 9:00 California.

We invite comments, questions, and new ideas regarding design patterns 
in decentralization and related technologies.

## What to expect during the DOTS Assembly

Our Assemblies are hour-long, participatory events where we set the agenda depending on the people in the room. Our focus will be on design aspects in decentralization, but we explicitly welcome non-designers and non-developers to join the conversation as well!

- Hello & welcome!
- Agenda hacking
- Presentation and/or breakout sessions
- Last 10 min: new pattern requests & proposals

We will be hosting the event on [Gather Town](https://gather.town/), which is a virtual space that enables many conversations at once.
