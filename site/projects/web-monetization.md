# Barriers to Adoption for Web Monetization

In today’s online world businesses routinely use algorithmic insights into who
a potential customer might be, and what they might be interested in purchasing,
to increase purported ad relevance. From a corporate perspective, this
intrusive approach has been a runaway success. The surveillance of users and
the subsequent monetization of their data has powered the dramatic rise of many
of Silicon Valley’s most profitable companies. Yet from a human-centered design
perspective, the process of personalized advertising has been toxic. Users no
longer simply consume products on the web -- they have become the product.

Mass targeted advertising has also created a series of societal and safety
issues, ranging from coordinated misinformation campaigns to invasive mobile
pop-ups. Despite these and other persistent problems, many users have continued
to tolerate the current ad-based structure of the internet in an
un-bargained-for and unequal exchange to access purportedly “free” information.
But as these extractive practices continue to expand their scope, and users
across the globe continue to gain awareness of these issues, attention has
begun to shift towards finding a new way forward. How can websites continue to
get paid for web traffic without employing targeted advertising? 

The [Web Monetization API](https://webmonetization.org/) is a new standard that proposes a technical answer to
this complicated question. In doing so, it offers a piece of technology that
has up to this point been absent in web browsers: the ability for users to
transfer miniscule amounts of money as an ad-free means to compensate websites
and their creators. Still, for many users, much remains unknown about this
innovative technology.

This project, supported by the [Grant for the Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/), seeks to address this gap in
knowledge by creating a better understanding of the current obstacles to the
widespread adoption of decentralized identity and web monetization. In doing
so, extensive research was conducted to reveal an in-depth depiction of the
existing ecosystem from the user’s perspective. This document identifies
several opportunities for expanding the adoption of web monetization.
