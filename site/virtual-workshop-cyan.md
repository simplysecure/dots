# Invitation

## Join our virtual design workshop this fall!

Decentralization is full of hard UX problems waiting for talented designers to tackle. This fall, we invite you to collaborate with a community of designers interested in building a library of design patterns for decentralization.

- Security & authentication
  - Who can see what, and for how long?
  - Why can't certain data be deleted?
  - What happens if a device is lost?
- Online status & synchronization & availability
  - Does this network require the Internet to work?
  - What does it mean to optionally use the Internet?
  - Will my content be available at all times? How reliable is this service?
- Licensing & intellectual property

There will be two parts to this workshop series. The first one introduces the existing design patterns and use cases. The second one takes the existing design patterns further and provides more structure for the corresponding use cases. View our first set of design patterns [here on GitHub](https://github.com/simplysecure/dots-patterns/).

By participating in this workshop series, you get to:

- learn more about decentralization technologies;
- contribute to a field driven by empowerment, resilience, and sovereignty;
- develop completely new and ground-breaking designs;
- meet other like-minded folks in this area.
